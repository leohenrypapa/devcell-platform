# DevCell Platform — Quick Overview

DevCell is CSD-D’s internal development and automation hub. It combines a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and a local LLM + RAG engine to support tasks, projects, standups, training, and malware research workflows.

The platform is designed for small development cells. Tasks and projects track day-to-day work, standups feed AI summaries, and the knowledge base stores SOPs, playbooks, and lab notes. All AI features run on internal hardware with no external SaaS dependencies.

Use DevCell as the single place to create work, document decisions, and ask questions against indexed knowledge.

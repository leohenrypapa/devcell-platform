# Guide — Getting Good Answers from RAG

RAG works best when queries are specific and grounded in how documents were written. Instead of asking “What is DevCell?”, ask “How does DevCell track tasks and projects?” or “What are the steps to ingest a new training document?”

Use keywords that appear in titles and headings: “standup summary,” “training pipeline,” “malware lab safety,” or “IOC correlation dashboard.” If the first answer is too generic, refine your question with more context, such as a date range, project name, or phase number.

When you find a helpful answer, open the source document, skim it quickly, and update it if anything is out of date. RAG quality improves over time as notes get clearer and more structured.

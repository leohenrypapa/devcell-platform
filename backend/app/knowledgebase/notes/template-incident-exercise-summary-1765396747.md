# Template — Incident / Exercise Summary

Use this template when documenting an incident, exercise, or notable lab run:

Context: What scenario were we investigating? Include date, system or range, and high-level objective.

Observations: Summarize the most important events, logs, or behaviors. Focus on patterns, not raw data.

Findings: List confirmed IOCs, techniques, or misconfigurations discovered during analysis.

Actions Taken: Describe containment, eradication, or lessons applied in training.

Follow-On Work: Create tasks or projects for remaining work and link them here.

Storing consistent summaries in the knowledge base allows RAG to reconstruct timelines and surface related cases quickly.

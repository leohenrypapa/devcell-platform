# SOP — Malware Lab Safety and Scope

Malware research must stay strictly isolated from production and user networks. All experiments occur inside dedicated lab environments with snapshot support, restricted egress, and monitoring. Never run untrusted binaries on personal laptops, shared infrastructure, or mission systems.

Before starting a lab, confirm: the VM image is current, snapshots are configured, and the network profile matches the exercise instructions. After running a sample, collect artifacts, reset to a clean snapshot, and document findings in the knowledge base or project tasks.

All work performed in the lab is for defensive research and training purposes only. Do not repurpose lab tooling for unauthorized activities.

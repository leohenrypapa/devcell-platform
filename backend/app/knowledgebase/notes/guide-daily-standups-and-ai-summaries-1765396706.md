# Guide — Daily Standups and AI Summaries

Standups are lightweight daily check-ins. Each entry answers three questions: what you worked on yesterday, what you plan to do today, and what is blocking you. Link to specific tasks when possible so that the system can build a clean picture of progress.

After team members submit entries for the day, the AI summary button generates a consolidated overview. This includes completed work, emerging risks, and cross-team dependencies. The admin or team lead can paste this summary directly into leadership updates or use it to adjust priorities.

Short, concrete bullets work best. Avoid copy-pasting log files; instead describe what changed and why it matters.

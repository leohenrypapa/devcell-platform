# Guide — Writing Good Knowledge Base Notes

The knowledge base is optimized for short, focused documents. Each note should cover one topic: an SOP, a troubleshooting guide, a design decision, or a lab write-up. Clear titles and first paragraphs improve retrieval quality for RAG queries.

Good notes:

Start with a one-sentence summary.

Describe the context and when to use the procedure.

Capture the exact steps or key decisions.

End with links to related projects or tasks.

Avoid dumping entire codebases or giant logs. Those belong in repos or storage, not the knowledge base. Instead, summarize the important details and reference the original location.

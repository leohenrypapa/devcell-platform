# Training Pipeline — Phase 1–4 Overview

The DevCell training pipeline is divided into four phases. Phase 1 focuses on foundations: Linux, scripting basics, Git, and core networking. Phase 2 introduces malware labs, Windows internals, and safe debugging practices. Phase 3 moves into capability development, automation, and unit-specific tooling. Phase 4 emphasizes independent projects and peer review.

Each lab or quiz in the training portal is backed by tasks in the platform. Trainees track their work just like regular developers. Leads can review progress via project summaries, standups, and completion metrics in the training UI.

The goal is to make the jump from “student” to “contributor” as short as possible by using the same tools and workflows throughout.

# SOP — Tasks and Projects Workflow

Tasks represent atomic units of work. Every task should have a clear owner, a descriptive title, and a status of todo, in_progress, blocked, or done. Tasks can optionally be linked to a project for higher-level tracking.

Projects group related tasks under a shared outcome, such as “DevCell Platform Modernization” or “Training Pipeline Engineering.” Project status is planned, active, or completed. Standups reference tasks and projects so that AI summaries can automatically describe progress and surface blockers.

When possible, break large efforts into multiple small tasks. Update status frequently so dashboards and summaries stay accurate for leadership.

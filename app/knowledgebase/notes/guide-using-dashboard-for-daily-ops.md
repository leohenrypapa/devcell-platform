# Guide: Using the DevCell Dashboard for Daily Ops

The dashboard is the **home screen** for an individual developer.
It aggregates tasks, standup summaries, and AI-generated SITREPs.

## What You See

- **Today’s Tasks**: High-priority tasks due today or this week.
- **Recent Activity**: New tasks, project updates, and training events.
- **Standup Summary**: LLM-generated summary of your last standup entries.
- **SITREP Block**: Optional markdown summary for leadership briefs.

## Daily Battle Rhythm

1. Start the day on the **Dashboard**.
2. Skim SITREP + standup summary.
3. Jump into **Tasks** or **Training** depending on the plan.
4. End the day by updating **Standup** → which feeds back into dashboard.

## Demo Tips

- For leadership, emphasize that this view can be used as a **single pane of glass**
  for an individual developer’s workload.
- For developers, emphasize that the system reduces context switching:
  they don’t need three different tools just to start working.

# Training Notes: Malware Track – Phase 1, Week 1

**Focus:** Lab environment setup, basic Windows internals, and safety.

## Objectives

- Stand up an isolated malware lab (VM snapshots, network isolation).
- Review Windows process model and basic syscalls.
- Learn DevCell training workflow and how tasks are auto-generated.

## Lab Ideas

- Build a **Hello-World keylogger** in a safe, simulated environment.
- Use DevCell tasks to track:
  - “Set up Windows VM snapshot”
  - “Instrument basic process monitor”
  - “Document lab safety checklist”

## Integration with DevCell

- Roadmap text → **JSON training units** → **seeded tasks** per week.
- Students see training tasks in their **Tasks** view, not a separate system.

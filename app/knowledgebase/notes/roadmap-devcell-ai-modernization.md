# Roadmap: DevCell AI Modernization (High Level)

This roadmap is intentionally high-level and suitable for leadership briefings.

## 0–90 Days: Foundation

- Stabilize auth, projects, tasks, and training flows.
- Stand up local LLM and RAG stack.
- Migrate key SOPs and guides into the Knowledge Base.
- Deliver the **SDLC multi-agent demo** as a flagship use case.

## 90–180 Days: Expansion

- Add more automation agents (testing, documentation, SITREP drafting).
- Integrate DevCell into existing CPB workflows and ticketing.
- Build out more training tracks (Windows, Linux, exploit dev).

## 180+ Days: Scale

- Package DevCell as an internal **AI software factory** platform.
- Support multiple crews and mission teams from a shared baseline.
- Harden deployment, monitoring, and backup processes.

## Demo Usage

During a brief, you can show this document as the “north star” for where
DevCell is going, not just what exists today.

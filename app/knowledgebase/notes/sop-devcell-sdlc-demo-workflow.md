# SOP: DevCell SDLC Demo Workflow

This document describes how to run the end-to-end SDLC demo
in the DevCell Platform for leadership or visitors.

## 1. Demo Goals

- Show how **tasks, projects, standups, training, and knowledge** connect
- Highlight **multi-agent automation** for requirements → tasks → reviews
- Prove that DevCell works on a **single laptop** in an offline environment

## 2. Recommended Demo Flow

1. **Login as Admin**
   - Show user management and demo accounts.
2. **Switch to Projects**
   - Open the “Malware Training Pipeline” project.
   - Point out project members and roles (owner/member/viewer).
3. **Open Tasks**
   - Filter by project to show realistic task backlog.
   - Demonstrate status changes and progress updates.
4. **Run a Standup**
   - Create a standup entry and auto-generate tasks.
5. **Open Training**
   - Show the malware training syllabus and seed tasks.
6. **Use Knowledge Base**
   - Ask “How do I run the DevCell SDLC demo?” and show RAG answers.

## 3. Key Talking Points

- Everything runs **locally** with **SQLite + local LLM**.
- DevCell is a **developer assistant platform**, not just a chat UI.
- Workflows match real cyber dev processes: tickets, sprints, training, SOPs.

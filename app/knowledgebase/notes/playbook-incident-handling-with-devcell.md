# Playbook: Using DevCell During an Incident Exercise

This playbook shows how to use DevCell during a blue-team or incident
response exercise.

## 1. Before the Exercise

- Create a project: **“Incident Exercise – <Date>”**
- Add members from the exercise crew.
- Link any pre-read documents into the **Knowledge Base**.

## 2. During the Exercise

- Log investigation actions as **tasks** under the incident project.
- Use **standups** as quick “mini-debriefs” each hour:
  - What did we try?
  - What did we find?
  - What’s next?
- Attach notes and artifacts in RAG-indexed docs for later review.

## 3. After the Exercise

- Use the **Dashboard SITREP** as a starting point for the formal report.
- Summarize the exercise using the template:
  `template-incident-exercise-summary-*.md` in the Knowledgebase.
- Feed lessons learned back into **training** and **checklists**.

## Demo Angle

For demo purposes, you don’t need a live incident. Just walk through
the workflow so leadership can see how DevCell would be used in a real event.
